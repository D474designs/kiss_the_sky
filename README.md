# Plant Evolution App

<br>
<br>

- [X] [Prototype 1](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app/tree/master/prototypes/prototype_1) - _Environment Physics & Basic Competitive Growth_  
- [X] [Prototype 2](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app/tree/master/prototypes/prototype_2) - _Flowers, Seeds, & Reproduction with Randomized Traits_  
- [X] [Prototype 3](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app/tree/master/prototypes/prototype_3) - _Seasons_

<br>

- [X] [Version 1.0](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app/tree/master/builds/v1.0) - _Genes, Alleles, Mutations, & Reproduction with Mendelian Genetics (random pollination among bloomed flowers)_
- [ ] [Version 1.1](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app/tree/master/builds/v1.1) - _Pollinators (selective pollination based on disirability of flower characteristics & accessibility of flowers to pollinators)_
- [ ] Version 1.2 - _Plant Branching_

<br>

- [ ] Version 2.0 - _Stylization (advanced sprouting, blooming, pod development, seed dispersal, and plant collapse animations, plus plant and flower petal styling, advanced colors and gradients, lighting, changing seasonal background imagery, possibly winter snowfall, etc.)_ 
- [ ] Version 2.1 - _Plant interaction (swiping for breeze, cutting/pruning) & gamification (storing & planting seeds, possibly ability to apply shade and/or other ways to manipulate environment, goals like height or flower color, etc.)_

to add/ideas:

 - performance enhancement
   - run sun rays less often with stronger intensity
   - remove more (all?) spans on plant collapse
   - fade out/remove plants earlier 
   - possibly run verlet less often
 - image capture every mid summer
 - ...

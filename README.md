to add/ideas:
   
<br>

 - update flower structure so that all points are non-verlet; instead, use simple x/y points placed relationally to uppermost segment using trig. Will fix inverted flower bug. (Can add 3 invisible segments to give flower effective physicality, so it will not pass through walls, etc.)
 - add complexity to flowers by adding radial symmetry, variable petal counts, petal layers, petal lengths, petal shapes, petal gradients/stripes, etc.
 - ability to isolate flowers in different sections so that only flowers in same section polinate one another
 - image capture & record every mid summer
 - ability to view first generation garden snapshot & compare to current
 - plant stalk branching and multiple flowers per plant
 - drawer with menu for each gene and current allele values averages, plus ability to select any individual plant to reveal its genes
 - social: users can trade flower breeds for cross-breeding
 - selective seed storing & planting
 - swiping for breeze on ambient mode
 - changing seasonal backgrounds to imagery of hills or woods, etc.
 - possibly winter snowfall
 - music & sounds (different music for different seasons, birds chirping, etc.)

to add/ideas:
   
<br>

 - update flower structure so that all points are non-verlet, built relationally around the uppermost segment; add complexity to flowers by adding radial symmetry, variable petal counts, petal layers, petal lengths, petal shapes, petal gradients/stripes, etc.
 - gamification: decide whether game should be based on goals like plant height/generations count/flower color/etc., or hybridizing/selecting beautiful complex flowers, or some combination of both?
   - flower qualities: petal count, color, etc.
   - plant height
   - color & height ( i.e., different goals progressively harder, like first to get a flower to touch the sky, then to get a red flower to touch the sky, etc.)
 - image capture every mid summer
 - possibly branching?
 - drawer with tree menu for each gene and current allele values averages, plus ability click plant to reveal individual plant's genes
 - social: users can trade flower breeds for cross-breeding
 - selective storing & planting seeds
 - swiping for breeze
 - cutting/pruning
 - changing seasonal background imagery
 - possibly winter snowfall
 - ability to isolate flowers in different dections so that only flowers in same section polinate one another
 - music & sounds (birds chirping)

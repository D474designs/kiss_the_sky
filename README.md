<br>

- [ ] Version 1.0 - _Genes, Alleles, Mutations, & Reproduction with Mendelian Genetics (random polination among bloomed flowers)_
- [ ] Version 1.1 - _Polinators (selective polination based on flower characteristics & accessibility)_
- [ ] Version 1.2 - _Plant Branching_

<br>

- [ ] Version 2.0 - _Stylization (advanced sprouting, blooming, pod development, seed dispersal, and plant collapse animations, plus plant and flower petal styling, advanced colors and gradients, lighting, changing seasonal background imagery, possibly winter snowfall, etc.)_ 
- [ ] Version 2.1 - _Plant interaction (swiping for breeze, cutting/pruning) & gamification (storing & planting seeds, etc.)_

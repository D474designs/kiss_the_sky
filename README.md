to add/ideas:

 - to make v1.1 presentable: 
   - app name and simple logo/title X
   - add "year _number_, _season_" to season meter, using attractive font X
   - add restart button X
   - add shadow visibility toggle X
   - add image download button X
   - slidable shades to let user control which plants get sunlight
   - basic gamification: grow a flower tall enough to reach the top of the viewbox in the fewest generations, "kiss the sky"
   - at startup, provide info about how app harnesses biological evolution via plant competition for height/light.
   - allow users to choose 1) "tiny white flower" or 2) "random garden" to "see what happens" as the years pass and the plants evolve. (maybe add option for one small & one large plant also.)
   - "Sew" button that kicks of initial falling seeds.
   - fix safari issues (color value floats, etc.)
   - fade out shadows when leaf angle falls to below about -80 degrees from horizontal (will avoid narrow shadows when leaves are vertical as well as shadows flasing off at plant death)
   - omit pod closure at plant death
   - add shadow to gap between leaves
   - performance enhancement: run sun rays less often with stronger intensity (probably need to address plant color-change flashing)
   - fix all forward growth based on y-values by replacing with trig formula to ensure new growth is forward regardless of stalk angle
   - change petal borders to darker hue of petal color

 - update flower structure so that all points are non-verlet, built relationally around the uppermost segment; add complexity to flowers by adding radial symmetry, variable petal counts, petal layers, petal lengths, petal shapes, petal gradients/stripes, etc.
 - gamification: decide whether game should be based on goals like plant height/generations count/flower color/etc., or hybridizing/selecting beautiful complex flowers, or some combination of both?
   - flower qualities: petal count, color, etc.
   - plant height
   - color & height ( i.e., different goals progressively harder, like first to get a flower to touch the sky, then to get a red flower to touch the sky, etc.)
 - image capture every mid summer
 - possibly branching?
 - drawer with tree menu for each gene and current allele values averages, plus ability click plant to reveal individual plant's genes
 - social: users can trade flower breeds for cross-breeding
 - selective storing & planting seeds
 - swiping for breeze
 - cutting/pruning
 - changing seasonal background imagery
 - possibly winter snowfall
 - ability to isolate flowers in different dections so that only flowers in same section polinate one another
 - music & sounds (birds chirping)

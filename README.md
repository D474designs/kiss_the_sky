to add/ideas:

 - to make v1.1 presentable: 
   - app name and simple logo/title with decent font 
     - _dark, garden, flora, meiosis, lost, sun, light, evolve, pollen, photo, photosynthesis, shine, grow, natural, select, selection, hybrid, nudge ..._ 
     - Dark Garden, Lost Garden, Pollen ... 
   - at startup, provide info about how app harnesses biological evolution via plant competition for height/light.
   - allow users to choose 1) "tiny white flower" or 2) "random garden" to "see what happens" as the years pass and the plants evolve.
   - "Sew" button that kicks of initial falling seeds.
   - add "year _number_, _season_" to season meter, using title font 
   - add restart button
   - add shadow visibility toggle
   - add image download button
   - fix safari issues (color value floats, etc.)
   - slidable shaders to let user control which plants get sunlight
   - performance enhancement: run sun rays less often with stronger intensity (probably need to address plant color-change flashing)
   - (possibly, some basic gamification like plant height or generation count)
   
<br>

 - update flower structure so that all points are non-verlet, built relationally around the uppermost segment; add complexity to flowers by adding radial symmetry, variable petal counts, petal layers, petal lengths, petal shapes, petal gradients/stripes, etc.
 - gamification: decide whether game should be based on goals like plant height/generations count/flower color/etc., or hybridizing/selecting beautiful complex flowers, or some combination of both?
 - image capture every mid summer
 - possibly branching?
 - drawer with tree menu for each gene and current allele values averages, plus ability click plant to reveal individual plant's genes
 - social: users can trade flower breeds for cross-breeding
 - selective storing & planting seeds
 - swiping for breeze
 - cutting/pruning
 - changing seasonal background imagery
 - possibly winter snowfall

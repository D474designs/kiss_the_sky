### [Plant Evolution App](https://github.com/matthewmain/plant_evolution_app) 
### Version 1: Genes, Alleles, Mutations, & Reproduction with Mendelian Genetics

<br>
<br>

- [X] genetics handler with allele, gene, genome, genotype & phenotype object constructors
- [X] gene dominance/recessivity, with "complete", "co", and "partial" dominance types
- [X] convert variable plant traits as genes, including flower color, leaf frequency & length, stalk width, etc.
- [X] pollination events when open flowers are randomly pollinated by other open flowers
- [X] meiosis event following pollination when parent genes combine to create a child genotype with combined inherited traits, stored as zygote genotype in new seed
- [X] phenotype event following meiosis when a plant's expressed traits are extracted from genotype and applied as fixed plant variables to seed before plant growth
- [X] gene mutations
